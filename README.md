## Spotify skill
A skill allowing the user to play spotify playlists on their spotify connect enabled devices

## Description 
### Authorization:
The skill uses the OAuth gateway on Mycroft home. After installing the skill go to home.mycroft.ai, select skills and click connect. This will start the authorization process and will ask you for permission to use your Spotify account. **Note** This feature is still in a pre-release state and may not work 100% of the time.

### Playing on the Mark-1
On the Mark-1 the skill will start up *librespot* if the user and password is entered in the skill settings allowing playback on the device.

### Todo
- Default volume on Mark-1 is too loud when librespot is started the volume should be lowered to a good level.
- Add general music search, artist, albums, tracks
